To see implementation of all models，please refer to:
- 'Group_6 bike_sharing_prediction source code.py'

This code:
- Loads and preprocesses the dataset hour.csv, day.csv.
- Performs feature engineering.
- Trains all three regression models (OLS Linear Regression, L2-regularized Gradient Descent, L1-regularized LASSO).
- Evaluates the models on train/validation/test sets.
- Produces the result plots and printed metrics.

The final result is in the result.png.
